                    My full name is <strong>Laura Chapa Gonz√°lez</strong>. I am <strong>24 years old</strong>, but when
                    people ask me about my age I tell them I am much, much younger <i>(just kidding!)</i>. I have had a
                    certain inclination for <span class="underlined">biology</span> and <span class="underlined">math</span>
                    since I can remember. I used to dig for bugs and play with them, not cockroaches, though, those
                    scare
                    the bejesus out of me; I also liked to watch surgery videos and liked to know how the human body
                    works.
                    Due to all these likings, I decided to major at Biomedical Engineering, as it had everything I
                    expected
                    concerning the anatomical and physiological part of the human being and engineering subjects like
                    math,
                    science, chemistry, physics, etc.
                    <br>
                    I like a lot watching football, but mostly when the Mexican National Football team is playing. I
                    used
                    to play this sport and some others like basketball and volleyball. I completely <strong>ADORE</strong>
                    dancing as I used to dance jazz, hip hop and ballet. There was a time where I had to juggle between
                    basketball, jazz and ballet all in the same day, so you can pretty much say I was quite an active
                    girl.
                    <br>
                    Other likes I have:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>French language and most of the things that have to do with France</li>
                    <li>Videogames! (mostly, one in particular: <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>)</li>
                    <li>Llamas and alpacas (they are <i>oh so cuuuute!</i>)</li>
                    <li>Pizza, pasta and most Italian food</li>

                </ul>
